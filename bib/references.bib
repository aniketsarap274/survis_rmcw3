  abstract={Quantitative measurement of cell cycle progression in individual cells over time is important in understanding drug treatment effects on cancer cells. Recent advances in time-lapse fluorescence microscopy imaging have provided an important tool to study the cell cycle process under different conditions of perturbation. However, existing computational imaging methods are rather limited in analyzing and tracking such time-lapse datasets, and manual analysis is unreasonably time-consuming and subject to observer variances. This paper presents an automated system that integrates a series of advanced analysis methods to fill this gap. The cellular image analysis methods can be used to segment, classify, and track individual cells in a living cell population over a few days. Experimental results show that the proposed method is efficient and effective in cell tracking and phase identification},

  abstract = {This paper develops a pattern recognition and machine learning system to localize cell colony subtypes in multi-label, phase-contrast microscopy images. A convolutional neural network is trained to recognize homogeneous cell colonies, and is used in a sliding-window patch based testing method to localize these homogeneous cell types within heterogeneous, multi-label images. The method is used to determine the effects of nicotine on induced pluripotent stem cells expressing the Huntington's disease phenotype. The results of the network are compared to those of an ECOC classifier trained on texture features. The ability of the network to localize cell phenotypes within heterogeneous colonies is visualized and the temporal behavior of stem cells is analyzed.},

    ABSTRACT = {Frequently, neural network training involving biological images suffers from a lack of data, resulting in inefficient network learning. This issue stems from limitations in terms of time, resources, and difficulty in cellular experimentation and data collection. For example, when performing experimental analysis, it may be necessary for the researcher to use most of their data for testing, as opposed to model training. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to perform dataset augmentation using generative adversarial networks (GAN) to increase the classification accuracy of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained on induced pluripotent stem cell microscopy images. The main challenges are: 1. modeling complex data using GAN and 2. training neural networks on augmented datasets that contain generated data. To address these challenges, a temporally constrained, hierarchical classification scheme that exploits domain knowledge is employed for model learning. First, image patches of cell colonies from gray-scale microscopy images are generated using GAN, and then these images are added to the real dataset and used to address class imbalances at multiple stages of training. Overall, a 2% increase in both true positive rate and F1-score is observed using this method as compared to a straightforward, imbalanced classification network, with some greater improvements on a classwise basis. This work demonstrates that synergistic model design involving domain knowledge is key for biological image analysis and improves model learning in high-throughput scenarios.},

  abstract = {Cell shapes provide crucial biological information on complex tissues. Different cell types often have distinct cell shapes, and collective shape changes usually indicate morphogenetic events and mechanisms. The identification and detection of collective cell shape changes in an extensive collection of 3D time-lapse images of complex tissues is an important step in assaying such mechanisms but is a tedious and time-consuming task. Machine learning provides new opportunities to automatically detect cell shape changes. However, it is challenging to generate sufficient training samples for pattern identification through deep learning because of a limited amount of images and annotations. We present a deep learning approach with minimal well-annotated training samples and apply it to identify multicellular rosettes from 3D live images of the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo with fluorescently labeled cell membranes. Our strategy is to combine two approaches, namely, feature transfer and generative adversarial networks (GANs), to boost image classification with small training samples. Specifically, we use a GAN framework and conduct an unsupervised training to capture the general characteristics of cell membrane images with 11,250 unlabelled images. We then transfer the structure of the GAN discriminator into a new Alex-style neural network for further learning with several dozen labeled samples. Our experiments showed that with 10-15 well-labeled rosette images and 30-40 randomly selected nonrosette images our approach can identify rosettes with more than 80% accuracy and capture more than 90% of the model accuracy achieved with a training data et that is five times larger. We also established a public benchmark dataset for rosette detection. This GAN-based transfer approach can be applied to the study of other cellular structures with minimal training samples.},

  abstract={Stem cell plays an important role in repairing destroyed tissues and keeping human healthy every day; and thus stem cell observation and detection are principle procedures before being analyzed by physicians. In this paper, we proposed a criterion of Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system to detect stem cells in the stratum basale based on cell segmentation algorithm and intrinsic characteristics of cells, which can provide consistent and accurate results for assisting the assessment of diagnosis. In addition, we utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to recognize basal cells and stem cells since CNN has excellent performance on processing abundant data. Actually, the procedure of acquiring biomedical images is too complicated to collect, hence hand-crafted initialization is adopted to overcome the issue of the lack of training data according to prior knowledge or the suggestion from medical doctors. The experimental results show that the accuracy of hand-crafted initialization is higher than random distribution kernels and the convergence time is shorter also since a better initial condition may lead to better results in optimization theory},

  abstract={Detecting mitosis from cell population is a fundamental problem in many biological researches and biomedical applications. In modern researches, advanced imaging technologies have been applied to generate large amount of microscopy images of cells. However, detecting all mitotic cells from these images with human eye is tedious and time-consuming. In recent years, several approaches have been proposed to help humans finish this job automatically with high efficiency and accuracy. In this review paper, we first described some commonly used datasets for mitosis detection, and then discussed different kinds of methods for mitosis detection, like tracking based methods, tracking free methods, hybrid methods, and the most recently proposed works based on deep learning architecture. We compared these methods on same datasets, and found that deep learning based approaches have achieved a great improvement in performance. At last, we discussed the future possible approaches on mitosis detection, to combine the success of previous works and the advantage of big data in modern researches. Considering expertise is highly required in biomedical area, we will further discuss the possibility to learn information from biomedical big data with less expert annotation.},

    abstract = {Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are characterized by two remarkable peculiarities: the capacity to propagate as undifferentiated cells (self-renewal) and the ability to differentiate in ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm derivatives (pluripotency). Although the majority of ESCs divide without losing the pluripotency, it has become evident that ESC cultures consists of multiple cell populations highlighted by the expression of early germ lineage markers during spontaneous differentiation. Hence, the identification and characterization of ESCs subpopulations represents an efficient approach to improve the comprehension of correlation between gene expression and cell specification status. To study markers of ESCs heterogeneity, we developed an analysis pipeline which can automatically process images of stem cell colonies in optical microscopy. The question we try to address is to find out the statistically significant preferred locations of the marked cells. We tested our algorithm on a set of images of stem cell colonies to analyze the expression pattern of the Zscan4 gene, which was an elite candidate gene to be studied because it is specifically expressed in subpopulation of ESCs. To validate the proposed method we analyzed the behavior of control genes whose pattern had been associated to biological status such as differentiation (EndoA), pluripotency (Pou5f1), and pluripotency fluctuation (Nanog). We found that Zscan4 is not uniformly expressed inside a stem cell colony, and that it tends to be expressed towards the center of the colony, moreover cells expressing Zscan4 cluster each other. This is of significant importance because it allows us to hypothesize a biological status where the cells expressing Zscan4 are preferably associated to the inner of colonies suggesting pluripotent cell status features, and the clustering between themselves suggests either a colony paracrine effect or an early phase of cell specification through proliferation. Also, the analysis on the control genes showed that they behave as expected.},
